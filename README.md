# ARDrone_Control
Control AR drone from a python script

The script should allow you to control an ARDrone 2.0 directly from teh 'Controller_.py' script, no need to modify any of teh folders.
All of the commmands are  based on the pyardrone library, so look that up if you want to create your own application(I highly suggest this)
